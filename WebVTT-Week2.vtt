Hello! I am Anusha Muthiah and welcome to week 2 of the Introduction to HTML5.

1
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:09.899
This week, we are going to cover global and

2
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.533
non-global attributes and how to use them, paying close attention

3
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:17.333
to the commonly used ones such as 'id' and 'class'.

4
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:19.599
In addition, you'll learn about the importance of separating content

5
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.033
and style in HTML5,

6
00:00:22.033 --> 00:00:24.999
as well as look at the difference between semantic and style tags.

7
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.932
We will study semantic elements, why they are important as well as look at their usage in various examples.

8
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:35.866
In the second half, we will cover how to add images to your HTML.

9
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.866
Images make everything more interesting.

10
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:41.732
For example, we will learn how to use the image tag and its attributes.

11
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:45.366
We will also look at scenarios where it is more appropriate to add images

12
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:49.032
using CSS instead. Finally, we will learn how to add hyperlinks

13
00:00:49.033 --> 00:00:53.899
to your Web page and their different uses. At the end of each subsection, you'll be able to do

14
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.333
exercises based on what you've learned

15
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:58.799
and test your knowledge by doing a quiz.

16
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.600
We hope you enjoy the course and happy learning!
